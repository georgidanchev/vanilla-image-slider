The tutorial used can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcdBOoK3Pfw&feature=youtu.be). I found this tutorial in the YouTube recommendation sections, it's a bit unusually basic for me it lacks the sophistication or elegance that I look for, but it showed me few ideas on how I might create carousels from scratch in the future.
